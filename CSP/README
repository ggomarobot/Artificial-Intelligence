Compile/run:

     - run executable with
            python solver.py CrosswordBoardFile DictionaryFile [AC3-Preprocess]

    first input file should specify the width and height of a puzzle board.
    second input file should be a list of english words

    If a third argument is provided, of any sort, then pre-processing will be performed,
    which reduces the domains of the variables by eliminating values that cannot be part of a consistent solution,
    and causes the search portion of the method to run much more quickly.
